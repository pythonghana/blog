## Making Impact In a Tech Community As a Volunteer


[PyLadies Ghana](https://ghana.pyladies.com/) is an initiative under the Python Software Community in Ghana ([Python Ghana](https://www.pythonghana.org/)) focused on bridging the diversity gap in tech by empowering more ladies making them become active participants and leaders in Python and the open-source Community.

Welcome to our first PyLadies Night of the year!ü•≥üíÉüèΩ

This is an in-house session for members and women in tech to share their expertise and abilities with other Python ladies.

On Friday, March 18th, 2022, we had a session with Aseda Addai-Deseh, during which she described her experience as a volunteer in the tech community and how to have an effect while doing so. 

She is currently the PyLadies Ghana Data Science Lead. In addition, she is pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science.

According to her, a volunteer is someone who contributes to the community voluntarily and because they enjoy and value what they do. 

She told us about her volunteering experiences which included teaching kids how to code, teaching underprivileged girls and young women electronics and web development, and organizing tech events among other things.

Fun fact: She can paint and draw, as well as solve a Rubix cube in under 60 seconds.
