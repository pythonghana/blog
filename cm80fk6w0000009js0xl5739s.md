On this International Women's Day, PyLadies Ghana proudly celebrates the achievements, resilience, and contributions of women in technology. Our theme year is, **‚Äú Accelerate:Invest in Pythonista Women - Build, Lead, and Inspire‚Äù**, which resonates¬† with our mission, our commitment to create¬† an inclusive and supportive environment for women in Python programming and fostering a community where women are not only participants in tech but also builders, leaders, and sources of inspiration.

## **The Journey of PyLadies Ghana**

PyLadies Ghana has been at the forefront of empowering women in tech through mentorship, bootcamps, training, and community engagement. Since our inception, we have worked tirelessly to bridge the gender gap in technology by equipping women with the skills, confidence, and opportunities they need to excel.

Through our diverse initiatives ranging from hands-on Python workshops, Data Science Bootcamps, DjangoGirls bootcamps, cybersecurity training, and networking events we have created a platform where women can learn, collaborate, and thrive. Our goal is to ensure that more women are not only participating in tech but also leading and shaping its future.

## **Build, Lead, and Inspire: The Power of Investing in Women**

Investing in Pythonista women is more than just providing technical training; it's about creating an ecosystem that nurtures growth, fosters leadership, and encourages innovation. When we invest in women, we enable them to build impactful solutions, lead transformational projects, and inspire future generations.

We celebrate the amazing women championing the PyLadies Ghana mission (PyLadies Ghana Leads).

Grace Osei - Administrator, SOC Analyst and Content Writer at¬† PyLadies Ghana

***I'm Abigail Akua Safoa, a proud mom of two and entrepreneur behind SNE Fabrics in Ghana. Growing up in rural Ghana, I was fascinated by tech, but my path was redirected from STEM to social sciences in high school. I have a degree in psychology and Master‚Äôs in international relations, exceling in the social sciences, yet feeling an unrelenting pull towards STEM.***

***In 2024, I decided to rekindle my tech dreams, thanks to a friend who introduced me to PyLadies. This workshop marked the beginning of my tech journey. Despite being new to tech, PyLadies boosted my confidence, encouraging me to pursue my passion.***

***I enrolled in a six-week cybersecurity training program in Offensive Security organized by PyLadies Ghana, which led me to apply for the CyberHer program by GirlyTech. I was selected to continue my cybersecurity journey and am now preparing for my ISC2 certification.***

***I'm thrilled to have volunteered with PyCon Africa and solidified my connection with PyCon Ghana. My short-term goal is to secure a cybersecurity certification, while my long-term aspiration is to land a remote cloud security analyst position.***

***For me, cybersecurity is more than a career path ‚Äì it's a journey that redefines my purpose.***
