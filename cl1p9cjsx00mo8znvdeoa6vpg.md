## Python Applications - Python Ho April Meet-Up

Just as we ended our first meet-up on February 1st, 2019 with much energy and vim to come back and pick up from where we left off, we decided to revisit something very basic but important during our second meet-up - **Python Applications**.  
  
_Why Python Applications as a theme for our April meet-up?_   
We all have had the experience of learning to code and writing basic commands in a new language which we're just getting started with and get lost all of sudden being overwhelmed with loads of tutorials and just marking time from one blog post to the other teaching the same thing - over and over again!  
  
_"learning to code is a good thing, but actually building a product or solving a problem is the Key"_ - and that's why we decided to put our Python skills to great use by building real-world applications and hence our April meet-ups focus.  
Our April meet up was practically based on focusing on web development using the Django Web framework, 

*   web scraping/scripting

  
with a balanced attendance of 18 members between our male and female community members this time around.  
  
[@osamfrimpong](https://www.twitter.com/osamfrimpong), a freelance software developer and a medical student - community lead, and our guest took time to well structure his presentation on Scraping the Web with Python with a hands-on project to further explain certain technicalities and the tools needed to successfully write a scraping script in Python and why the need for / or to Scrape data from the Web.
