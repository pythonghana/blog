Our latest Python Kumasi meetup was a resounding success featuring an exciting presentation by Johanan Oppong Amoateng on VetDataHub an open source project to centralize veterinary data into a single repository for AI and ML Research. There was heavy rain in the morning so the session started at 11 am instead of the 9 am it was scheduled for. 11 members were in attendance.

### Johanan Oppong Amoateng

A veterinary student and a backend developer gave a thought-provoking talk on VetDataHub a project he is working on which aims to centralize all the publicly available veterinary data into a single repository to aid in research and analytics. He shared the core principles of his project which included data accessibility, ethical use, and ensuring quality, and why open veterinary data was important.

After the presentation, there was a tutorial session on file handling and Exception handling. Attendees were given the opportunity to ask Allen Eben questions related to Python and its technologies and programming in general. The meetup was a success and it closed at 2 pm.
