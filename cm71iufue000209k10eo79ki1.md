Our in-person session on August 3rd marked the conclusion of our data series, providing participants with a hands-on experience in data science. The day began with Peter Mapuchi, a dedicated volunteer from Python Accra, who guided participants through the basics of Python. This introduction was tailored to help beginners get up to speed and offer a refresher for those with prior experience.

This event capped off our data series, which began with Datacraft Ignite webinar series. At that event, Afi Kwaeyakyie Blebo and Joshua Obeng delivered insightful talks on *“How to Get Started with Data Science”* and *“The Roles of Data Science and AI in Industry.”* Following that, Derek Degbe led a more advanced session on *“Managing and Building an ETL Pipeline,”* diving deeper into the complexities of data science. A snippet from one webinar can be found below.

The latest Python Accra Build Session focused on practical applications of data analysis, data science, data engineering, and machine learning. Participants engaged in building a simple project using linear regression, guided by Daniel Atsibre. By the end of his session, everyone had successfully created a linear regression model, equipping them with a solid foundation to advance their skills further.

Julius brought energy and expertise to his session on leveraging the Gemini API for intelligent data analysis. He demonstrated how to optimize the data analysis process and work more efficiently. Participants explored using the Gemini API in their IDEs, implementing data analysis solutions with Python at the core. This session not only enhanced their technical skills but also encouraged smarter approaches to data analysis.

The build session's lightning talks covered a range of topics, from technical challenges to business strategies. Seidu discussed managing multiple Python versions on one machine, while Selasie Pecker introduced machine learning with Python. Nana Kweku explored how microservices can benefit businesses, and Jason Quist delved into reinforcement learning. Zenas Awuku wrapped up with a session on data analysis using Python. Each talk offered practical insights, sparking interest and inspiration among the audience. Each talk was packed with valuable information, leaving the audience inspired and eager to explore these topics further.

Overall we had an amazing session with good feedback we continue to empower the Python community in Accra!
