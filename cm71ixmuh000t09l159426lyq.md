On the 19th of October Python Kumasi organized the monthly meetup for October.The meetup was held at Computer Lab, KsTU. The event was a two part series on Django models, forms and views. This series was designed for those who had a bit of familiarity with Django basics and were eager to complete their understanding.

The event began at 9:30am with an introduction and icebreaker session by the Python Kumasi Lead Allen Eben Tetteh which set a friendly and welcoming environment. He welcomed everyone and encouraged the attendees to network among themselves.

* **Forms:** We picked up where we left off, further discussing form validation and handling more complex user inputs.
    
* **Models:** Attendees got a deeper understanding of Django models, including relationships and database management best practices.
    
* **Views:** Since we didnâ€™t finish views in the last session, we focus on creating dynamic views and efficiently connecting them with models and templates.
    

After the tutorials , we had lunch and snacks whiles talking about general python topics. A discussion with the atttendees was had on what to project to work on to solidify their understanding of Django and it was decided the artendees would work on a peer review system in the upcoming months.

### Conclusion

The event concluded susccessfully with attendees leaving with a better understanding of Django Models,Views and Forms.
