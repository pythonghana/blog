## PyLadies Night with Eva Mwangi

She is a Python Developer, currently working at Getinnotized as a Technical Test Engineer. Her responsibilities include planning and executing tests on Web and mobile applications. She writes and refactors automated tests on a daily basis. She also does code reviews with developers which has forced her to fall in love with Java, Javascript, and PHP. She also leads the testing team at GetInnotized.

Eva leads /organizes codebar Accra, which is an organization that provides a safe space for underrepresented people in Tech to connect, network, and learn. Before Getinnotized, she was an Entrepreneur in Training at MEST, where she studied Software Engineering and Entrepreneurship.

  

Eva is in a transition phase to Data Science. She believes in everyone's responsibility to challenge the status quo and is happy [PyLadies](https://twitter.com/PyLadiesGhana) does challenge the status quo in our community. She also watches the movie "Hidden Figures" at least twice a week

  

**_Tell us one word that best describes you_**

I think "**determined**" is the word I will use

  

Has it been IT always? Or how did you venture into this field?

I studied computer science. To be honest I touched my first computer at 17 years of age. I wouldn’t say I have always been in Tech.

  

**_Did you have any mentors? Since it was quite new, what kept you going?_**

I am Kenyan, we go to High school for 4 years, after that we stay home for around 6 months, after which we join college. My mum wanted me to be independent and she ask me to get a job. My first job was cleaning computers. My boss at the time forced me to learn a word, excel, PowerPoint, etc After learning those, he took me to his lectures. He was working as a lecturer at a university in Kenya. That way he became my first mentor. He wanted me to audit Technology courses and know where I wanted to be. After I knew I wanted computer science I went out looking for people who inspired me.

  

**_Tell us about the others_**

In my first year, I joined the Google developers Group. In the group, there were a few ladies. I started hanging out with them, and they would take me to meet-ups like Andela, akirachix, and other groups. In the GDG group, I started taking responsibilities, the leads there were willing to direct me and sometimes take a fall for mistakes I made.

  

**_Was it hard adapting as a lady. Even now do you think there are any hurdles for ladies in IT?_**

Yes, it was challenging. 90% of the time I was expected to be serving snacks instead of answering tough tech questions during events. Sometimes when I was in an assignment group there would be that guy who wouldn't want me to write code because I might not do it well. Like most of us in this group, I have asked myself whether I am really capable. All of you know that small voice in your head, right? For students, you know when you go to ask a question about a bug and the boy simply takes your computer and writes the whole program for you. In the work area though, I have become more intentional about who affects me, but because I lead a team, I get to observe how women are treated. I think things are getting better every day.

  

**_You have experience with Java, Javascript, PHP, and then Python. Is there anything about Python that stands out for you? What has your coding experience been so far?_**

Yes, it was challenging. 90% of the time I was expected to be serving snacks instead of answering tough tech questions during events. Sometimes when I was in an assignment group there would be that guy who wouldn't want me to write code because I might not do it well.

**_How did you explore all these technologies? Any link to resources you use?_**

I am a big fan of videos. So youtube is my university. But I was given a trick by my boyfriend, he is Ghanaian by the way
