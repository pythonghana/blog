We're thrilled to announce that the Python Ghana Conference 2025 dubbed Pycon Ghana 2025 is happening this September in Accra!

This is an all size fits all conference, whether you’re a first-time coder, an experienced developer, or someone using tech to make a difference in your community , this is your space.

This year, we’re coming together under the theme:

🎯 “PYTHON FOR EVERYONE: SHAPING CULTURE, CAREER, AND COMMUNITIES.”

Our goal is simple: to create a welcoming space where people across Ghana, Africa, and beyond can connect, learn, and grow through the power of Python.
