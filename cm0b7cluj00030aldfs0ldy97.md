The Python Kumasi Meetup held at KsTu on 27th July was a success which brought together python enthusiasts from different backgrounds to learn about writing web applications with Python using the Django Web Framework. In this blog post, we'll recap the highlights of the event, covering key topics discussed, insights shared, and the overall experience of attendees.

### Event Highlights

The event got started with a welcome from the Python Kumasi Lead Allen Eben, setting the stage for an engaging and informative session. Attendees, ranging from beginners to seasoned developers, gathered to explore Django foundational concepts and gain practical insights into how to build web applications with it.

### **Introduction to Django**

The first session was an introduction to Django, where we explored the history, philosophy, and key features of the framework. We discussed how Django simplifies web development by providing a high-level, open-source framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

#### Hands-On Workshop: Building a Simple Web Application

Next, we moved on to a hands-on workshop. Participants were guided through the process of setting up a Django project. We built a simple web application step-by-step, covering essential concepts like:

1. **Project Setup**: Installing Django and setting up a new project.
    
2. **App Creation**: Creating a new app within the project.
    
3. **Models**: Defining models and using Django's ORM to interact with the database.
    
4. **Views and URLs**: Creating views and mapping URLs to views.
    
5. **Templates**: Using Django's templating engine to render HTML pages.
    
6. **Admin Interface**: Leveraging Django's built-in admin interface for managing data.
    

Participants followed along, coding in real-time, and had the opportunity to ask questions and get immediate feedback. The collaborative environment was buzzing with energy as everyone worked together to build their first Django application.

#### Break and Networking

After the intense coding session, we took a well-deserved break. This was a perfect opportunity for participants to network, share experiences, and discuss potential collaborations. The meetup provided a platform for developers to connect and learn from each other, fostering a sense of community.

#### Q&A and Open Discussion

To wrap up the day, we had an open Q&A session where participants could ask questions about any challenges they faced or clarifications they needed. The interactive discussion highlighted common issues and best practices, providing valuable insights for everyone.
