the second session of our **‚ÄúLeveling up Python: Web Intro Series‚Äù** ‚Äî a hands-on, progressive learning track tailored to help developers in Ho build web applications using Python and Django. This session, held at **Node Eight** on **Saturday, March 29, 2025**, zoomed in on the inner workings of Django to give attendees a stronger grasp of what happens under the hood.

**Saturday, March 29, 2025,** our March meetup marked session two of our planned three part **Web development series using Python and Django** - intended to be a hands-on, progressive learning to help attendees gain a stronger grasp of what happens under the hood working with **Django.**

#### **The Deeper Look into Django**

The focus of our March meetup was going a little deeper into the **Django web framework**, where we broke down the essential components that power every Django application. The topics covered included:

* **Models** ‚Äì Understanding how Django models help map and manage data with ease using the ORM.
    
* **Views** ‚Äì Understanding the logic layer and how to return the right responses.
    
* **Templates** ‚Äì Crafting clean, reusable HTML with Django‚Äôs templating engine.
    
* **URLConf** ‚Äì Routing requests cleanly and efficiently through URL patterns.
    
* **Forms** ‚Äì Building and validating user input using Django Forms.
    
* **User Authentication** ‚Äì Exploring built-in tools for login, registration, and user management.
    

More than just theory, we continued building our community hub project - implementing custom user authentication, extended Django‚Äôs default user model, and explored permission management, laying the foundation for role-based access and personalized dashboards.

#### **Up Next?**

The finale of the series will focus on **deployment and DevOps basics** ‚Äî going from localhost to Live! **üöÄ** pushing Django apps to the web with tools like **Digital Ocean** and **GitHub Actions**. We‚Äôll walk through deploying our community hub app so participants can proudly share their projects online.

We envisage our web intro series to be a great way to grow with the Python User Group Ho community and whether you are just starting out or sharpening your backend skills, there‚Äôs something for everyone. You can join us and take off from where we will be continuing with the help of dedicated members willing to help and support everyone grow.
