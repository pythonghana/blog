The community's first PyLadies Night for 2023 was hosted on Twitter Space with an engaging panel discussion on the theme "Volunteer with PyLadies Ghana; Empower Your Network, Empower Your Career." The panel featured three of our PyLadies as speakers: Yaa Nuamah, Abigail Afi Maame, and Theresa Seyram. We will be delving into the key takeaways and valuable insights shared during this enlightening discussion.

**Overview of the Panel Discussion:**

The panel discussion revolved around the empowering potential of volunteering with PyLadies Ghana and other tech communities. It explored how volunteering can positively impact one's professional development, personal network, and attitude. The panellists shared their personal experiences with volunteering and expertise, shedding light on the transformative power of volunteering in the tech community.

As we all know, volunteering (paid or free) is like an extracurricular activity outside of our regular job. We looked at some of the benefits and important considerations to keep in mind when volunteering. Yaa mentioned that while it may not be possible to immediately identify potential concerns in a community when applying as a volunteer, it would be helpful to pay attention to certain aspects highlighted by the panellists.

During the discussion, we discussed key factors to consider, such as the community's goals and values, the approach to communication and collaboration, and the specific roles and responsibilities expected from volunteers. By being attentive to these factors, individuals can make more informed decisions about their volunteer commitments and ensure a positive and fulfilling experience within the community.

#### Benefits Of Volunteering

The panellists enlightened us about the numerous benefits of volunteering, which encompass a wide range of advantages. Some of these benefits, although certainly not limited to them, include:

1. Personal Fulfillment: It provides an opportunity to make a positive impact on others' lives and society as a whole, fostering a deep sense of satisfaction and purpose.
    
2. Expanding One's Network: Volunteering opens doors to expand and diversify one's network. These connections can lead to valuable friendships, mentorship opportunities, and professional collaborations, enriching both personal and career prospects
    
3. Skill Development: Through volunteering, individuals can acquire valuable experiences and hands-on training that may not be readily available in their regular work environment.
    
4. Personal Growth: Volunteering promotes personal growth and self-discovery. It allows individuals to step out of their comfort zones, take on new challenges, and develop a broader perspective of the world.
    
5. Career Advancement: Volunteering can positively impact one's professional journey. It provides opportunities to showcase skills, gain practical experience, and demonstrate a commitment to social responsibility.
