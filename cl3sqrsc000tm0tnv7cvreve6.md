## Announcing PyCon Ghana 2022

Ayeekoo Pythonistas!

We are super excited to announce and welcome you to another rendition of PyCon Ghana!

We are back, after the lengthy hiatus due to being the host of [PyCon Africa 2019](https://bit.ly/PyConGH-PA19) and the pandemic.

First and foremost, we would like to send our very best to everyone as we all continue to navigate the challenges of COVID-19. We have implemented COVID-19 guidelines and protocols to be followed by attendees at the PyCon Ghana 2022.

In the meantime, our organizers and volunteers are working hard to bring you a fun, informative, and energizing event filled with loads of networking, tutorials, in-person collaboration, open-source contributions, and so much more! Not to mention the great fun it will be gathering together once again after a long while. 

**More on the event:**
Over the span of 3 days from the **13th to 15th of October 2022**, attendees will have the opportunity to participate in workshops, attend live keynote sessions and talks, as well as get to know fellow members of the Community and beyond.

We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with novice to advanced level presentations. Tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases. The conference is organized by the people for the people providing an excellent quality level of content. Newcomers are explicitly welcome!

We are really excited about this!

Canâ€™t wait to see you all.
