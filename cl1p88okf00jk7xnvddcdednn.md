## PyLadies Tarkwa Meetup 1.0

As the first-ever meetup for [PyladiesTarkwa](https://twitter.com/PyladiesTarkwa) was planned to come off on 16th February 2019, did happen, It was amazing seeing four ladies from different fields of engineering making time out of their busy schedules to meet with one passion to learn how to code with the Python Programming Language at 12:30 pm at the [University of Mines and Technology](https://www.umat.edu.gh/), library discussion room.

  

The session started with building a network among the new faces seen. It was a very interactive session where we got to know each other's passions. After which there was an introduction from the coach who shared her experience. We then delved into the general overview of programming with python, and the opportunities available, and also motivated the ladies to set goals in other to reach higher heights. All mentioned above constituted the informal session. Before the tutorial session started, the coach went around the tables and made sure each lady had their IDE installed and had Python running.

Looking at the encouraged faces of the ladies, we delved into Python, by learning the basics of programming with python. Most were surprised at seeing a few lines of codes, executed very simply; they were inspired to learn more because it was easy.

Here are a few words from the participants about their experiences.

The python programming language is a very easy and friendly language in terms of its syntax as compared to other programming languages. This makes it easy for individuals with little or no knowledge about programming to get well acquainted with the programming world. From my perspective, **_I feel python is the best language, to begin with when starting your programming journey_.**  

PyLadies is a good initiative because it helps not only women offering computer-related courses but also women from diverse fields to at least get a feel of programming without much stress but with little effort and dedication they are able to do wonders. This initiative just started and I’m already having a feeling it is going to be massive, more exciting, and more inspiring as the years go by. With PyLadies Tarkwa, not only have I been able to learn the language, but I also have met women from diverse fields. This I believe will help broaden my horizon as we interact and share ideas.    _~ Fatima- Bint Ibrahim_

My enthusiasm to learn a programming language died down in my first lecture. I found it very boring. It seemed very complex too (maybe because of the kind of tuition I got). I lost interest at some point. Though I managed to pass my exam, I was not confident in my ability hence would not put it out anywhere that I could code.

I saw PyLadies Tarkwa as a chance to learn so I decided to go for it. The first meet-up was a very exciting experience. Finding me amongst ladies like me who were ready to learn and share their knowledge was just the right atmosphere. On my first try, I was very excited and desired to continue. _**Python is very simple and easy to use.**_ It was presented to us in a simple manner and tutored such that I found it very interesting.

I am very confident this would be an amazing learning experience. I look forward to solving problems around me with the knowledge and skills I would acquire. _~ Kate Walker_

Having all the fun by experiencing python, time was not on our side, so we had to draw the curtains down and get to another fun session of photoshoot with the coach and participants and after which we had some refreshment. PyLadies Tarkwa's very first meetup was a success, very exciting, and most of all, a daring one for me – but thanks to the Almighty God for granting us the opportunity to host this session. I am so happy.


We, therefore, say thank you to [The Python Software Foundation (The PSF)](https://www.python.org/psf/), [Python Ghana](https://www.pythonghana.org/), [PyLadies Ghana](https://twitter.com/PyLadiesGhana) and to the [PyladiesTarkwa](https://twitter.com/PyladiesTarkwa) team.
