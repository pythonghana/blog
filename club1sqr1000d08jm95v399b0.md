We were in much anticipation for when our community events and meetups will kick off for the year 2024. Finally a first of few planned *meetups* was held on Saturday 23rd March, 2024 at Node Eight, Ho. 14 members in attendance - *11 in person, 3 via Meet (online).*

Our latest Python User Group *meetup* was a night of learning and exploration, featuring five exciting presentations, each took turns after the other, what a joyful night it was. New ideas shared, a lot of techniques and approach discovered. Mystery around coding and working with data unravelled. What more can we ask for?

### **Aaron Yankey**

Thrilled to welcome Aaron, a prominent figure in the Python community. Aaron, who holds positions at the Python Software Foundation (PSF), co-founded 2pi real intelligence, and created [Elon EMF](https://elonemf.io/login)

> An Intelligent Framework, that is designed to make work more pleasant to all workers. I am designed with flexibility, scalabilty, security and speed at my core. I hope you enjoy your experience with me, as we work together.

, kicked off the evening with a thought-provoking talk. His presentation sparked a lively discussion about the future of work and the role of intelligent tools.

**Python in the Browser: A Refreshing Take**

Following Aaron's talk, we delved into a fascinating presentation that challenged our perspective on Python. The talk explored the intriguing possibility of leveraging Python's unique multi-threaded architecture to run Python code directly within web browsers.

This innovative approach opened our eyes to new possibilities for web development and sparked discussions about potential applications and challenges.

I believe we're just getting started, a lot to learn from industry folks and from the community at large. Artificial Intelligence is here to stay and we're also poised on unravelling the very nitty gritty concepts around it for development and improvement both in our works and daily lives.

**A Night of Learning and Community**

The *meetup* was a success, promoting a lively exchange of ideas and knowledge, with presentations offering valuable insights and encouraging attendees to explore new avenues within the community and the Python ecosystem at large.

**Stay Tuned!**

We're excited to continue providing informative and engaging *meetups*, so stay tuned for upcoming events and connect with fellow Python enthusiasts in our community.

[Python User Group Ho on GitHub](https://github.com/hopythonusergroup) is now on [GitHub](https://github.com/hopythonusergroup), follow our page and contribute to our community effort. A lot more is coming. Let's build a vibrant community together.

Hope to see you in the next one. Chaw!!!
