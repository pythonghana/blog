## Why you should learn Python

Python is a general-purpose language, which means it can be used to build just about anything, which will be made easy with the right tools/libraries. Professionally, Python is great for backend web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. Many developers have also used Python to build productivity tools, games, and desktop apps, so there are plenty of resources to help you learn how to do those as well.

Python was designed to be easy to understand and fun to use (its name came from Monty Python so a lot of its beginner tutorials reference it). Fun is a great motivator, and since you'll be able to build prototypes and tools quickly with Python, many find coding in Python a satisfying experience. Thus, Python has gained popularity for being a beginner-friendly language, and it has replaced Java as the most popular introductory language at Top U.S. Universities.

Python can be used for a wide variety of applications, and as you learn the basics of Python, you’ll be able to create almost anything you want. Many great developers contribute daily to the Python community by creating Python libraries. These libraries can help you get started so that you don’t have to write code to reinvent the wheel. So for example, if you want to do complex image processing, the Python Imaging Library will help you get started. Want to create games? PyGame is a Python game engine. If data science is your thing, SciPy is the library for you.

**“Why” **Python has emerged as one of the most popular programming languages on the market:


- 
**Quick to setup: **Python is easy to download, even for the newbie; careful documentation takes you through the download and setup steps in either Windows, Mac, or Linux environments. Tons of support and documentation make Python learning fairly manageable. If you want to jump right into Python without any need for download on your machine, just go to one of many online tutorials like Codecademy.
    
- 
**Python is fast:** Python has developed a reputation as a solid, high-performance language. Lots have been done in recent years to get to this point. The PyPy project aims to speed up Python as a whole (and is doing a great job of it). And Numba is another tool that can offer amazing speedups by implementing high-performance functions written directly in Python.
    
- 
**Python has broad support:** The applications for Python are broad and varied; it’s used by individuals and big industry players alike in everything from systems automation, testing, and ETL to gaming, CGI, and web development. Disney uses Python to help power its creative process. And Mozilla releases tons of open-source packages built-in Python. Bank of America uses Python to build new products and interfaces within the bank’s technology infrastructure.
    
- 
**Ease of use:** Python gets a lot of accolades for being easy to learn, and rightfully so. The learning curve is very gradual. Other languages can be quite steep. Python places a heavy emphasis on readability, as shown by its comparison with other object-oriented languages.


Python powers Django, a complete and open source web application framework. Frameworks - like Ruby on Rails - can be used to simplify the development process. It has a massive support base thanks to the fact that it is open source and community developed. Millions of like-minded developers work with the language on a daily basis and continue to improve core functionality. The latest version of Python continues to receive enhancements and updates as time progresses. This is a great way to network with other developers.


Finally, Python is widely used, including by a number of big companies like Google, Pinterest, Instagram, Disney, Yahoo!, Nokia, IBM, and many others. The Raspberry Pi - which is a mini computer and DIY lover's dream - relies on Python as its main programming language too. You're probably wondering why either of these things matters, and that's because once you learn Python, you'll never have a shortage of ways to utilize the skill. Not to mention, since a lot of big companies rely on the language, you can make good money as a Python developer
