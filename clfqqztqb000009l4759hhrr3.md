International Women's Day is a time to reflect on the achievements and struggles of women throughout history. This year, Pyladies Ghana took the opportunity to focus on the UN global theme **"DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality.**" The event highlighted the role that innovation and technology can play in achieving gender equality and encouraged women in technology to be agents of change.

The panel discussion included outstanding women from diverse technical fields, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, open-source contribution, and software engineering.

With their outstanding contributions to STEM in Ghana, these trailblazing women—Miss Deborah Kanubala, Miss Naa Ashiorkor Nortey, Miss Aseda Addai-Deseh, Miss Lily Edinam Botsyoe, Miss Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe, and Miss Afi Maame Dufie—have set an example for future generations of women to pursue careers in technology with confidence. They highlighted the significance of diversity and representation in the technology industry during the discussion.

These ladies firmly believe that championing gender equality in technology can create a more inclusive and diverse tech community. Drawing from their personal experiences and insights, they also emphasized that women can effect significant change in the industry regardless of their position or level. They also emphasized the importance of mentorship and support for women just starting in technology. The goal is to facilitate the growth and success of women in the industry by providing guidance and support to aspiring female tech professionals.

In addition to discussing the importance of gender equality and diversity in technology, the panelists also highlighted the need to address systemic barriers that prevent women from pursuing careers in STEM. Specifically, they emphasize the significance of early exposure to technology for girls and providing access to the internet in rural areas, believing that these actions can help break down long-standing obstacles and encourage more women to enter and thrive in STEM fields.

Moreover, the panelists emphasized the critical role of machine learning fairness in the pursuit of gender equality in technology. By identifying and mitigating biases in hiring practices, promotion, and algorithmic design, we can create a more equitable and just society for women and other underrepresented groups in STEM. Overall, the event highlighted the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in technology, as well as the need for continued efforts to overcome barriers and create a more equitable future.

In summary, the commemoration of International Women's Day serves as a pivotal moment to acknowledge and honour the accomplishments of women while reiterating our commitment to the ongoing pursuit of gender parity.

Pyladies Ghana remains steadfast in its resolve to leverage technology and innovative practices to advance gender equality and foster an all-encompassing tech industry. We extend an open invitation to join us in our unwavering mission toward a future characterized by equality for all, and you can watch the recording of the event at the YouTube link below.
