We want to proudly say we have wrapped up our **“Level Up Your Python: Web Series”** with an exciting finale focused on deploying Django apps - from localhost to live production! 🚀 After three months of learning, building, and growing together.

Held on Saturday, April 26, 2025, at the Ghana Registered Nurses and Midwives Association Hotel in Ho, this final session brought together Python and Django enthusiasts for a practical, hands-on walkthrough of taking web projects beyond development to real-world hosting.

Led by our guest speaker [Bilesanmi Ahmad](https://x.com/femibilesanmi),- a *Senior Software Engineer at Complete Farmer*. The session titled **“Level Up Your Python: From Localhost to Live”** elaborated the deployment process for Django applications. Participants learned how to:

### **Wrapping Up Our Web Journey**

Our Web Series journey started in February 2025 with the basics of Django, continued with a deeper dive into Django’s core concepts in March, and now culminated with learning how to confidently ship projects to the world.

Throughout this series, participants not only improved their backend development skills but also built real-world projects like our **Community Hub** app - gaining practical experience from database modeling to deployment.

🌟 **A huge thank you to every participant, coach, and volunteer who made this series possible!**

At Python User Group Ho (PyHo), we believe in learning by doing and growing together as a community. Whether you’re just beginning or advancing your skills, there’s always a space for you with us.

\- **next up, we’re diving into the future with our May meetup on Agents in AI! 🤖**

It promises to be an exciting, hands-on exploration of intelligent workflows, automation, and building your first AI agents. Stay tuned

Until then - keep building, keep deploying, and keep leveling up! 🚀
