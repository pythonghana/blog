In an engaging kickoff Allen Eben and Martin Arbogeh organized a tutorial session on lists, functions and classes and their applications in real world codebases. The eager learners and attendees were able to appreciate when and how to use these concepts and had the opportunity to use them to build mini projects.

A break was given for attendees to network and introduce themselves. This introductory period allowed the attendees to connect ensuring everyone had made a new friend or a connection.
