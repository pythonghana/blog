From lively discussions to debugging session wins, the room was buzzing with curiosity and shared learning at the "Agents on the Ho-rizon" meetup. Held on Saturday, June 28, 2025, the event brought together tech enthusiasts for an insightful and hands-on session focused on AI agents, autonomous workflows, and cutting-edge tools.

> "Think of AI agents as smart assistants that can understand, decide, and use tools to get real tasks done — with autonomy."

## The Deep Dive into Agents

Led by **Gabriel Agbobli**, a data scientist and a community builder, introduced the Agent Development Kit (ADK) - a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents, though optimised for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is **model-agnostic** and **deployment-agnostic**, ensuring compatibility with various frameworks.

The meetup provided attendees with a comprehensive understanding of how AI agents function in practical scenarios, covering everything from task automation to sophisticated decision-making processes. exploring the core concepts of AI agents, - defined as autonomous programs that interact with AI models like Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform goal-based operations.

## **A community Vibe and Hands-on learning**

The session included a live demonstration of basic agent workflows utilizing LLMs and open-source tools, providing valuable practical experience. The interactive segment fostered an open-floor discussion where we share ideas, challenges, and aspirations related but not limiting to AI, engineering best practices, collaboration and team work. The energy and collaborative spirit within the community were palpable, reinforcing the shared goal of shaping a vibrant developer ecosystem in Ho and beyond.

## **More innovation on the Ho-rizon**

The Python User Group Ho Team is already gearing up for future exciting events. The upcoming July meetup, titled "Beyond the Buzz: Building Real Stuff with Web3," will focus on Blockchain/Web3. Looking ahead, August will feature "Stack the Future: Blending AI, Web3 & IoT," and a tentative "Build. Break. Innovate. Hackathon" is scheduled for October.

These initiatives underscore the team's commitment to continuous learning and innovation within the tech community.
